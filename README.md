Upcoming Events: [https://www.meetup.com/Code-Patterns/events/](https://www.meetup.com/Code-Patterns/events/)



Why start from scratch? Every week we share a complete solution to a common development pattern. Come to learn, accelerating your development cycle, or signup to share a development pattern of your own. 

Covering: Data Science, Machine Learning, Cloud Native Development, DevOps, and more.
We operate on a simple code of conduct (eloquently put by Cocoapods) - [Don't be a jerk](http://cocoapods.org/legal).
